# Boulder Release Process Docs & Demo

A repo for documenting and demonstrating the
[Boulder](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder) release process used to move
code from Github to [staging](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/)
and [production](https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/).

## Goals

1. When we need to do a hotfix deploy, we can easily do one that contains only
   the fixes needed for hotfix, regardless of what changes have been committed
   in the meantime.

1. Any code we deploy meets our standard [code review
   process](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#review-requirements)
   and has passed all automated tests.

3. Any commit we deploy is eventually made available in the public boulder repo.

4. The hotfix release process differs as little as possible from the scheduled
   release process.

## Release Schedule

Boulder developers make a new release at the beginning of each week, typically
by 10am PST **Monday**. Operations deploys the new release to the [staging
environment](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/) on **Tuesday**,
typically by 2pm PST. If there have been no issues discovered with the release
from its time in staging, then on **Thursday** the operations team deploys the
release to the production environment.

Holidays, unexpected bugs, and other resource constraints may affect the above
schedule and result in staging or production updates being skipped. It should be
considered a guideline for normal releases but not a strict contract.

## Making a Release

### Regular Releases

For regular staging releases, each week the Boulder dev team will tag the
current main commit with the current date, making a tag prefixed by
`"release-"` (e.g. `release-2018-01-22`). The tag name will always be the date
the release is tagged, not the date that it is pushed to staging or production.
If multiple releases are tagged on the same day the tag will be given an
incrementing letter suffix (e.g. `release-2018-01-22a`)

### Hotfix Releases

#### When main is clean

When main is clean, and has no commits that we do not wish to include in the
hotfix release, then the regular release process is used. The hotfix lands in
main after the normal review process and a dev tags a new release per "Regular
Releases".

#### When main is dirty

When main is dirty, and has commits that are unrelated to the hotfix and too
risky to ship to prod we need to use an adjusted hotfix process. In this case
dev team will create a branch based on the current release tag prefixed by
`release-branch-`. Pull requests with the hotfix code will be made against the
release branch based on the normal Boulder development process. Once the
neccessary changes have been merged to the release branch dev team will create
a new hotfix release tag based on that branch.

## Deploying Releases

When doing a release, Ops' tooling will check that:

1. Travis shows that tests have passed for the commit at the planned release tag.

2. The planned release tag is an ancestor of the current main on GitHub **OR**
   the planned release tag is equal to the head of a branch named
   `release-branch-XXX`, and that branch contains a release-tagged commit, and
   all commits since then have followed the Boulder review process.

3. Each commit on the hotfix branch references a PR, and that PR was reviewed,
   and the PR page shows the final merged commit id.

## Prerequisites

* You must have a GPG key with signing capability:
  * [Checking for existing GPG keys](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-gpg-keys)

* If you don't have a GPG key with signing capability, create one:
    * [Generating a new local GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
    * [Generating a new Yubikey GPG key](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013790259-Using-Your-YubiKey-with-OpenPGP)

* The signing GPG key must be added to your GitHub account:
  * [Adding a new GPG key to your GitHub
    account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)

* `git` *may* need to be configured to call the correct GPG binary:
  * The default: `git config --global gpg.program gpg` is correct for most Linux platforms
  * On macOS and some Linux platforms: `git config --global gpg.program gpg2` is correct

* `git` must be configured to use the correct GPG key:
  * [Telling Git about your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)

* Understand the [process for signing tags](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-tags)

## Example

* On `2018-01-30`, @cpu submits [a pull request](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/pull/1), proposing a feature to be merged to `main`.

* @jsha reviews and [approves the PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/pull/1#pullrequestreview-92717219). The corresponding [travis build](https://travis-ci.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/builds/64669844?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification) passes, and so [@cpu merges the PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/commit/500b4c3c010b7f8d97aca106aa76550b5cff72f0) into main.

* Later that day, @cpu cuts a release by making a [`release-2018-01-30` tag](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/releases/tag/release-2018-01-30) from the [tip of `main`](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/commit/500b4c3c010b7f8d97aca106aa76550b5cff72f0) at the time of tagging.

* Ops deploys `release-2018-01-30` some time later.

* After deploying `release-2018-01-30` a critical bug is discovered! Since `main` is clean, that is, has no commits since `release-2018-01-30` we don't want to ship with a hotfix, @cpu quickly prepares a [hotfix PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/pull/2) to propose a hotfix change be merged into `main`.

* @jsha reviews and [approves the hotfix PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/pull/2#pullrequestreview-92737652). The corresponding [travis build](https://travis-ci.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/builds/64675859?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification) passes, and so [@cpu merges the hotfix PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/commit/4ed5f8181852237dd6cde45fbc63bd199f2d3ec9) into main.

* With the `main` branch ready with a hotfix, @cpu cuts a hotfix release by making a [`release-2018-01-30a` tag](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/releases/tag/release-2018-01-30a) from the [tip of `main`](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/commit/4ed5f8181852237dd6cde45fbc63bd199f2d3ec9) at the time of tagging.

* Ops deploys `release-2018-01-30a`, fixing the bug

* On `2018-01-31`, @cpu submits a [pull request](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/pull/3) to propose a new feature be merged into `main`. 

* Later that day @jsha reviews and [approves the feature PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/pull/3#pullrequestreview-93045304). The corresponding [travis build](https://travis-ci.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/builds/64744142?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification) passes, and so [@cpu merges the PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/commit/e926651516f4c275740b68987481475495b55b65).


* Later on `2018-01-31` its discovered that the bug in `release-2018-01-30`, which was hotfixed with `release-2018-01-30a` is still broken! Uh oh! Since main is **dirty**, and contains a [feature commit](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/commit/e926651516f4c275740b68987481475495b55b65) not present in `release-2018-01-30` or `release-2018-01-30a` the hotfix must be prepared in a separate branch. @cpu starts a new branch [`release-branch-2018-01-30a`](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/tree/release-branch-2018-01-30a) by checking out `release-2018-01-30a` and pushing it as the release branch.

* In a new branch off of `release-branch-2018-01-30a` @cpu creates a hotfix and creates a [pull request](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/pull/5) proposing the hotfix be merged into `release-branch-2018-01-30a`.

* @rolandshoemaker reviews and [approves the hotfix PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/pull/5#pullrequestreview-93077656). The corresponding [travis build](https://travis-ci.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/builds/64779641?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification) passed, and so @cpu [merges the PR](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/commit/9242e5ce9e96b5d0fdbc5140c9a6f9dd983e0273) into `release-branch-2018-01-30a`.

* @cpu then cuts a new release from `release-branch-2018-01-30a` by making a [`release-2018-01-31` tag](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/releases/tag/release-2018-01-31) from the [tip of `release-branch-2018-01-30a`](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder-release-process/commit/4ed5f8181852237dd6cde45fbc63bd199f2d3ec9) at the time of tagging.

* Ops deploys `release-2018-01-31`, fixing the bug again without having to introduce unrelated code from `main`
